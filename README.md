# OperationHK

一個讓用戶以位置、圖片以及文字發放即時資訊嘅平台
A platform that allows user to share information with location, images and text

我哋係一群反對逃犯條例嘅香港人
我哋都唔希望呢條惡法會通過
當中有唔同取向嘅人

發起人小弟係一個和理非嘅惡法反對者
眼見政府係103萬市民遊行下仍然唔肯撤回條例
又見到警察對示威者、媒體甚至係救援人員作出完全不合理且過份嘅武力
所以決定企出嚟
提供一個平台
以互聯網技術提供即時嘅服務
讓示威者、媒體以至廣大市民具體地發布資訊


We are a group of Hong Kong people that oppose the Extradition Law. We do not want this bill to be passed, and we have people that have different opionions on the approach of that. 

I, the main author of this app, is a opposer that agrees with a peace, reasoable and non-voilence approach. Watching more than 1 MILLION HK Citizens (1/7) of the population marching in the city and the abuse of force by police on pretesters, medias and medical prersonnels, I decided to do something and hence provide a platform for pretesters, medias and everyone to publish information instantly and in a visualizeable way.
